# CropDefense

Crop Defense is a top down, two dimensional tower defense game. The code is based on, and expanded upon, a tutorial series by Kaarin Gaming (youtube.com/c/KaarinGaming - github.com/KaarinGaming), and etirtely within the Java Standard Library.

The game features a customizable map tool that allows users to create their own scenes on which to play the game. The map tool uses bitmasking to generate the proper terrain tiles, and AStar pathfinding for the enemy AI to find the quickest way across the paths of the maps.

This is my first complete game and project in Java. Enjoy!
