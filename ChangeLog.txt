Version 0.0.1

Save files for games are no longer created as soon as a new game is started.
Save files are now only created if a player chooses to save their game after the game has begun.
This way, a player can play a game from start to finish and not have to take up a save slot in doing so.

Minor changes to texts when starting a new game or selecting a file to either load or delete.
Added some background images behind these text for easier readability.

Credits are now two separate images, one for the background, one for the text.

Some very minor balancing and bug fixes.

Added a few comments to the code.
