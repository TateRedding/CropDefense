Version 0.0.1

Save files for games are no longer created as soon as a new game is started.
Save files are now only created if a player chooses to save their game after the game has begun.
This way, a player can play a game from start to finish and not have to take up a save slot in doing so.

Minor changes to texts when starting a new game or selecting a file to either load or delete.
Added some background images behind these text for easier readability.

Credits are now two separate images, one for the background, one for the text.

Some very minor balancing and bug fixes.

Added a few comments to the code.

Players can now gain a life if a wave is completed without losing a life.

Added more waves, and edited existing ones.

More minor balancing.

Players are no longer able to select a crop they can't afford.

Added a wave counter and an enemy counter to the action bar.

Names of maps are now displayed above the respective map button and thumbnail when selecting a map to play on or edit.
Name of the selected map is also displayed when choosing a map to play or edit similar to selecting a game save file.

Added some text to the save game screen to signify that you are in fact there to save your game, as it looked too identical to the load game screen.

Fixed bug where crops were incorrectly calculating whether or not an enemy was in range to attack.

Fixed bug where crops were aiming for the bottom right corner of an enemy's hitbox as opposed to the center.

Fixed bug where the save game screen would not warn a user that the game is not saved if the user clicked the 'X' to quit.

Fixed bug where projectiles were calculating their trajectory based on the top right corner of the crop, though they originate from the middle.

Further organization and abstraction of codebase
